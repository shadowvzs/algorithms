            <b>Name</b>: Backtracking Algorith
            <b>Type</b>: Brute force / Depth First Search
            <b>Description</b>: A backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach
            for finding the
            desired output.
            The term backtracking suggests that if the current solution is not suitable, then backtrack and try other
            solutions. Thus, recursion is used in this approach.

            This approach is used to solve problems that have multiple solutions. If you want an optimal solution, you
            must go for dynamic programming.

            For example, consider the SudoKo solving Problem, we try filling digits one by one. Whenever we find that
            current digit cannot lead to a solution, we remove it (backtrack) and try next digit. This is better than
            naive approach (generating all possible combinations of digits and then trying every combination one by one)
            as it drops a set of permutations whenever it backtracks.
